 ## Set-up
 
 This repo does not contain the node_modules folder as it is too big. 
 Be sure to have those installed before starting the app localy on your computer (or contact the repo owner to have them sent to you).
 In order to run the projects you'll need two seperate terminals (one for the client and one for the server to run).
 To start the client cd into the client subfolder and run:

 To start the server cd into the server subfolder and run:
 
 ![Snimka zaslona (12)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97118236/211031022-aae7a510-7df5-4d3e-83b0-cb2a003669d4.png)

 Following output should appear for client:

Ignore the error messages, the most important is that the last line has no error messages (only shows warnings which means the app will still be functional).
Client is running on: http://localhost:3000/

Following output should appear fro server:

Server is running on: http://localhost:5000/
